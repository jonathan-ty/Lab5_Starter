Check Understanding:
1. No we would probably not use unit testing to test the messaging feature as a whole since there are many different parts (different functions and actions) that would be difficult to test.
2. Yes, we could use unit testing, as this is a small enough feature to be successfully tested using unit tests. We can most likely isolate and test for the max message length using unit tests.
